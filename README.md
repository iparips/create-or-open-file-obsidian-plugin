# Create or Open File - Obsidian Plugin

This Obsidian plugin helps you create and open files based on predefined patterns, making it easier to maintain your daily notes, weekly plans, and other regularly used documents. It reduces cognitive load by automating the creation of files you use frequently.

Please note, I work on this during my spare time of which I have very little. If you find any issues feel free to raise a PR, but note it might take me some time to get back to you.

## Features

- Open or Create new files from templates
- Support for dynamic file paths using date-based patterns
- Time shift functionality for future/past dates
- Customizable command names for quick access
- Import and Export of custom command configuration as json files

## Examples

### Example 1: Weekly Shopping List

Create a new shopping list for the current week:

```yaml
Command name: "Shopping list"
Template file path: "00 - Meta/Templates/shopping-list-template.md"
Destination folder pattern: "01 - Journal/Weekly/Week-{week}"
File name: "shopping-list.md"
```

This will create: `01 - Journal/Weekly/Week-23/shopping-list.md` with the template's contents.

### Example 2: Tomorrow's Daily Note

Create tomorrow's daily note automatically:

```yaml
Command name: "Tomorrow's Daily Note"
Destination folder: "01 - Journal/Weekly/Week-{week}"
File name: "{month}-{day}-{dow}.md"
Time shift: "+1 day"
```

This will create: `01 - Journal/Weekly/Week-23/06-07-Sat.md` using tomorrow's date.

## Supported Placeholders

Use these placeholders in both destination folder paths and file names:

| Placeholder | Example | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `{year}` | 2025 | 4-digit year |
| `{month}` | 06 | 2-digit month |
| `{day}` | 07 | 2-digit day |
| `{date}` | 2025-06-07 | ISO date format |
| `{time}` | 14-30-45 | Time in HH-mm-ss format |
| `{week}` | 23 | ISO week number |
| `{dow}` | Sat | Day of week abbreviation |

## Time Shifts

Apply time shifts to adjust the date used for pattern resolution:

Format: `+N unit` or `-N unit`
- N: number
- unit: day(s), week(s), month(s), year(s)

Examples:
- `+1 day` ‚Üí Use tomorrow's date
- `-2 weeks` ‚Üí Use date from 2 weeks ago
- `+3 months` ‚Üí Use date from 3 months in the future
